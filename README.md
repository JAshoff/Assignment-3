# Sieve Analysis


Sieve analysis allows for civil engineers to assess the particle size distribution of any granular material of their choosing. By assembling sieves in a stack, the user insures that all material particles will be "caught" by one of the available sieves. After conducting the test, the individual mass reading for each sieve will reveal the distribution of the sample particles. Below is the necessary procedure, in my own words: 

# What you will need: 

  - Stack of test sieves
  - Scale
  - Pestle and mortar to crush the sample
  - Sieve Shaker 
  - Oven
  - Nylon Paintbrush
  

# Procedure

  1. Oven-dry a sample of granular material (a good sample should weigh about 500 grams)

2. If any lumps remain in your sample, crush them using the pestle and mortar.

3. Verify the weight of your sample to ensure it is close to 500 grams. 

4. Gather the weights of the indiviual empty sieves and record them. 

5. Assemble a stack of sieves in the sieve shaker. The sieve with the largest opening is placed at the top, while the sieve with the smallest opening is placed at the bottom, with decreasing size inbetween. A pan must be placed at the bottom of the stack to "catch" the smallest particulate.

6. Pour your sample into the top of the sieve stack, and clamp the stack into the sieve shaker. Set the timer on the shaker to between 10 and 15 minutes, and switch it on. This will distribute the material among all of the sieves. 

7. Stop the sieve shaker and weigh the individual particulate-filled sieves. Record the new sieve masses and compare them to the empty sieve masses. 

8. Using the weight of particulate in each sieve, approximate the new total weight of the sample. If it deviates by more than 2% away from the original value, the test results are inaccurate and the test must be restarted. 

9. Depending on the condition of the sieves after testing, a paintbrush cleaning may be required for the larger sieves (above 150 micron openings) If the sieves contain lodged particles in them, an ultrasonic cleaning may also be required. 


# Analysis
Now that the empty and post-test sieve masses are available, the user is now able to identify the fineness of the sample. This is done by subtracting the post-test mass by the empty mass, which represents the mass of the material. The user can calculate the percentage of the sample that is smaller than a certain sieve size, and create a distribution with this data.
